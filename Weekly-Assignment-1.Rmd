> A friend has asked you how to set up a GitHub web page in RStudio. Create an Rmarkdown file  that explains the steps of setting one up and any troubleshooting advice you learned that could help them. Make as clear and helpful a document as you can, including any links, notes, or pictures that you deem appropriate.  

**Knit your Rmd file to html and post a link to your Guide on your portfolio page.**
