## Working with matrices, lists, and data frames

1. Assign to the variable `n_dims` a single random integer between 3 and 10.

    - Create a vector of consecutive integers from 1 to $\mbox{n_dims}^2$.

    - Use the sample function to randomly reshuffle these values.

    - create a square matrix with these elements.

    - print out the matrix.

    - find a function in r to transpose the matrix.

    - print it out again and note how it has changed.

    - calculate the sum and the mean of the elements in the first row and then the last row.

    - set your code up so you can re-run it to create a matrix of a different size by only changing the `n_dims` value
