## BIOL1007A: Reproducibility in R. 
## W23

Reproducibility is essential at all stages of research and allows for the validation and replication of science, enhancing collaborations and connectivity. The open-source nature of R programming and its ability to analyze and visualize data sets make it a powerful tool in biology. In this course, we will learn the basics of reproducible coding in R and RStudio (no prior knowledge required). Primarily, we will cover: 

1) Data structures and creating publication-quality figures; 
2) How to ask and answer scientific questions using basic statistics; 
3) Creating shareable documents using Rmarkdown; and 
4) Reproducibility using GitHub, shell commands, and LaTeX - all within RStudio. 

Each week will involve a combination of structured lecture, group work, and coding exercises.
